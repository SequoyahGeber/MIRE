# Decision log

One entry per decision that would be expensive to reverse. **Append, never rewrite.** When you change
your mind, add a new entry that supersedes the old one — the reasoning you rejected is as valuable as
the reasoning you kept, and future-you (or an agent) will otherwise re-litigate it for free.

### D-001 · 2026-08-15 · Engine: Godot 4.7, pinned
Staying in Godot rather than moving to Unity (which Muck used). You already know it; the project is
already configured with Forward+ and Jolt; the high-level multiplayer API fits host-authoritative co-op
well; no revenue share; text-based project files work well with AI agents and git.
**Pinned version matters** — GodotSteam breaking on a point release produces long, confusing, expensive
debug sessions. Do not upgrade mid-milestone.
**Would change my mind:** spike R2 or R3 (`ARCHITECTURE.md` §6) failing catastrophically with no viable
fallback.

### D-002 · 2026-08-15 · Networking: host-authoritative listen server
No dedicated servers, no host migration, no rollback. Host runs the sim; clients predict their own
movement only. This is what Muck does and it's correct for 3–6 friends.
**Would change my mind:** wanting public matchmaking with strangers (would need dedicated servers and
actual anti-cheat).

### D-003 · 2026-08-15 · Multiplayer built first, before gameplay (M1)
Retrofitting multiplayer is the single most common way co-op hobby projects die — it means rewriting
every system that touches state, which is most of them. Given that quota is the binding constraint, a
rewrite of that size is not survivable.
**Would change my mind:** nothing. This one is load-bearing.

### D-004 · 2026-08-15 · First-person, viewmodel arms only
No full-body character animation pipeline, no locomotion blend trees, no IK, no third-person camera
collision. Saves an estimated 4–6 months of a skill you don't currently have. Muck proves FP melee works.
**Would change my mind:** playtesters consistently reporting they can't read melee range in FP. Mitigate
first with better hit feedback before considering third-person.

### D-005 · 2026-08-15 · Art: CC0 low-poly packs (Quaternius / Kenney), hero assets swapped later
$0, no attribution burden, and stylistically close to Muck already. Removes art as a blocker entirely
and defers all art cost until the project has proven it will survive.
**Would change my mind:** the game succeeding and the generic look becoming the main criticism. That's a
good problem, and the fix is commissioning hero assets, not restarting.

### D-006 · 2026-08-15 · Content is data (`.tres` Resources), not code
Items, powerups, recipes, enemy stats, Cycle Modifiers all live in Godot `Resource` files loaded at boot.
Framework built once with premium quota; content authored by hand in the inspector for free.
**This is a direct quota optimization** — it makes the 60th powerup cost the same as the 2nd, and zero
tokens either way.
**Would change my mind:** nothing. This gets more correct the longer the project runs.

### D-007 · 2026-08-15 · Agents write scripts; the human wires scenes
Godot `.tscn`/`.tres` files do not merge — they carry internal sub-resource and node-path IDs that
conflict badly and can silently corrupt. Restricting agents to `.gd` files makes parallel agent work
safe, and happens to match what each party is actually good at.
See `AI-WORKFLOW.md` §3.
**Would change my mind:** nothing, until Godot scene files become mergeable.

### D-008 · 2026-08-15 · Develop against Steam App ID 480 until M8
Valve's public test app. Full lobby + P2P + overlay with no Steamworks account and no $100. Defers all
cost and paperwork until the project has proven it will ship.
**Would change my mind:** needing achievements or Steam Cloud earlier than expected (both require a real
App ID).

### D-009 · 2026-08-15 · No win condition — endless Cycles with voluntary extraction
*Supersedes the original three-act, boss-at-the-end structure.*
Runs escalate forever via stacking Cycle Modifiers until the island is consumed or the team wipes. The
shipwreck is reframed from win condition to voluntary cash-out.
Three reasons this is better: (1) replayability comes from stacking modifiers rather than authored
content, which scales far better for a solo dev; (2) it removes a final boss — a large, risky, gating
chunk of work; (3) the ending is emergent (the island runs out) rather than something you have to
design, balance, and justify.
The "one evening" identity is preserved by the extraction decision and by tuning the wall to ~2–2.5h,
not by a timer.
**Would change my mind:** playtests showing nobody ever extracts (Q6) *and* the reward curve can't be
tuned to fix it — at which point reconsider a soft cap.

### D-010 · 2026-08-15 · A run is one sitting; no save/resume
Serializing world mutations, entity state, inventories, powerups, and the Mire grid is a large,
bug-prone body of work, and it's the kind of bug that only shows up in front of friends.
**Would change my mind:** 2h+ runs proving to be a real scheduling problem for your group in practice.
This is the #1 post-launch feature candidate.

### D-011 · 2026-08-15 · Multi-agent coordination via files in the repo, not a service
Three agents (Claude Code, Codex, human) share state through `.agent/state.json`, a generated
`.agent/BOARD.md`, and an append-only `.agent/JOURNAL.md`, driven by one small script `.agent/bin/agent`.
Chosen over a hosted tracker or MCP server because: every agent can already read files; it versions with
git for free; it costs almost nothing in tokens to read; and there's no service to break or authenticate
against. `AGENTS.md` is the protocol (now a cross-tool standard read by Codex, Cursor and others) and
`CLAUDE.md` is a thin pointer at it, so the rules live in exactly one place.
Enforcement is mechanical, not honour-system: a git pre-commit hook runs `agent check`, which blocks any
agent from editing a file another agent holds, and blocks *any* agent from editing `.tscn`/`.tres`
(D-007). A protocol that relies on agents remembering to follow it will not be followed.
**Would change my mind:** agents working concurrently often enough that file claims become a bottleneck —
at which point move to git worktrees per agent instead of claims.

### D-012 · 2026-08-15 · Agents may touch scene/config files only by claiming them **by name**
*Amends D-007, does not repeal it.*
The blanket ban made bootstrapping impossible — someone has to create `player.tscn` and write the input
map before there is anything to run, and doing that by hand in the editor is a 30-minute typo hazard on
action names the code reads by string.
The amendment: an agent may edit `.tscn`/`.tres`/`project.godot` **only** when it holds an explicit
claim naming that exact file. Drifting into a scene file is still blocked by the pre-commit hook. This
keeps the protection where it mattered (no accidental scene edits, no two parties in one scene) while
making deliberate, logged bootstrapping possible.
In practice the agent should still generate scenes *via a Godot tool script* rather than hand-writing
`.tscn` text, so Godot serialises its own formats — see `tools/setup_project.gd`.
**Would change my mind:** an agent corrupting a scene the human was actively working in. Then go back
to the blanket ban and accept the manual setup cost.

### D-013 · 2026-08-15 · Ship macOS + Windows + Linux, with cross-play, as a first-class constraint
Not a port done later. Steam P2P is platform-agnostic, so cross-play itself is nearly free — but it
imposes one real architectural risk: §4 has clients regenerating terrain from a shared seed, and
transcendental float results are not guaranteed identical across CPU architectures *or C libraries*.
Divergence would put two players in the same lobby on different islands.
`tools/check_determinism.gd` makes this measurable; the macOS arm64 baseline is recorded in
`ARCHITECTURE.md` §6a. Windows and Linux must be measured before anything is built on §4 (task 0.10).
Native Linux additionally makes Steam Deck support nearly free, and Linux's case-sensitive filesystem
surfaces a whole class of export bug early.
**Would change my mind:** hashes diverging. Then the host ships a compact heightmap and clients stop
regenerating — costs join bandwidth, removes the risk entirely.

### D-014 · 2026-08-15 · Claude Code (this session) is the planner; Codex and the second Claude are coders
Planner owns: design, architecture, roadmap and task breakdown, decisions, specs, and reviewing work
that lands. Coders own: implementing claimed tasks in `.gd`.
This concentrates the scarce premium quota on exactly the work `AI-WORKFLOW.md` §2 calls Tier 2 —
decisions that are expensive to get wrong — and pushes implementation toward the cheaper plans. It also
matches the constraint that the binding limit is tokens, not hours.
Consequence: the planner writes specs precise enough that a coder needs no exploration, since
exploration is the single most expensive agent activity.
**Would change my mind:** the coders producing work that needs so much rework that planning-then-
delegating costs more than doing it directly.

### D-015 · 2026-08-15 · R2 is GREEN — chunked terrain meshing stays in GDScript
`tools/bench_chunks.gd` builds a 32 m chunk (33×33 verts, 2048 tris) in **0.330 ms single-threaded**,
or 0.112 ms/chunk amortized through `WorkerThreadPool` — 24× under the 8 ms threshold, so we can
build 50 chunks in a single main-thread frame before threading enters the picture. `SurfaceTool` is
7% slower than writing `ArrayMesh` arrays directly, which is close enough that we use whichever reads
better. Memory is 43 KB/chunk live. Seeded generation is deterministic (same seed → identical verts),
which R6 still has to confirm holds across platforms.
No GDExtension, no C#, no threading until something proves it necessary.
**Would change my mind:** the two costs this spike did not measure turning out to dominate — GPU
upload (it ran headless against the dummy renderer) and **collision shape generation, which is still
untested**; R3 measured *navigation* baking, not physics. If `ConcavePolygonShape3D` cooking costs
more than the mesh build, chunk streaming gets rebudgeted around it, not around mesh generation.
**Both are now task `4.0a` (Spike R2b), a gate before 4.1** — this verdict is provisional until it
reports (`FINDINGS.md` F-005).

### D-016 · 2026-08-15 · R3 is GREEN — runtime NavMesh baking stays; enemy AI keeps NavigationServer3D
`tools/bench_navbake.gd` measured **0.034 ms of worst-case main-thread block across a realistic
24-chunk streaming episode** (bake, attach, retire a 3×3 live window), against a 2 ms budget. The
blocking bake costs 9.2 ms per 32 m chunk — 55% of a frame — so the rule is that
`bake_from_source_geometry_data_async` is the only bake we ever call; submitting one costs 0.004 ms
and attaching the finished region to a live map costs 0.003 ms. **The grid-A*-on-heightmap fallback
in `ARCHITECTURE.md` §6 R3 is not needed**, and we keep off-mesh links, dynamic obstacle avoidance
and `NavigationAgent3D` steering for free. R3 was the risk most likely to reshape the enemy design;
it didn't.
Chunk seams connect, but not with the defaults and not by the obvious route. Independent bakes leave
a hole exactly `2 × agent_radius` wide (1.00 m measured) because Recast erodes inward from the
geometry edge, and the default `edge_connection_margin` of 0.25 m cannot bridge it — agents simply
cannot path across a chunk boundary. **Set `map_set_edge_connection_margin` above 2 × agent_radius**
(1.10 m for our 0.5 m radius). `filter_baking_aabb` and `border_size` both *shrink* the result and
make it worse; a negative control confirms the wide margin does not link chunks 32 m apart.
Consequences for M4: one bake in flight at a time (16 fired in one frame blocks 6.8 ms), `cell_size`
stays at 0.25 m (scaling is steeply superlinear — 0.1 m costs 80.7 ms), per-chunk bakes rather than
one large region (a 4×4 bake costs 7.3 ms/chunk vs 9.6 ms for a single chunk, so there is nothing to
amortize), and map `async_iterations` stays on. Pathfinding is host-authoritative per §2.2.
**Would change my mind:** the block reappearing once real geometry — rocks, structures, `MultiMesh`
scatter — is in the source data rather than a bare heightmap, or the 1.10 m margin bridging terrain
that should stay separated once cliffs and water exist. Either pushes us to bake with
`agent_radius = 0` (measured: 0.00 m gap, connects on the default margin) and carry the agent radius
in `NavigationAgent3D` instead.

### D-017 · 2026-08-15 · R6 is GREEN for macOS↔Linux — §4 shared-seed world gen stands, and transcendentals are banned from it
`tools/check_determinism.gd` on macOS arm64 and Linux x86_64 (Godot 4.7.1-stable `a13da4feb`, both):
`rng_sequence`, `noise_simplex` and `noise_perlin` are **bit-identical**; `float_math` is not
(`063eec62c34fa4ee` vs `187304c753e6e1ce`). A follow-up per-operation probe put the divergence exactly
on the IEEE-754 line. Correctly-rounded-by-spec operations match everywhere: `+ − × ÷`, `sqrt`, and
`Vector2/3.length()` built on it. Everything routed to the platform's libm diverges by ~1 ULP:
`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `exp`, `log`, and `pow` at any exponent. **`FastNoiseLite` is in the safe group** —
integer hashing plus polynomial interpolation, it never calls libm — and it is the thing that actually
generates the island.

So the §6 R6 fallback (host ships a heightmap) is **not adopted**. Clients keep regenerating from a
seed, and the cost is a coding rule rather than join bandwidth: `ARCHITECTURE.md` §7 now bans
transcendentals from anything regenerated from a seed, and §4's island falloff becomes `1.0 - d*d*d`
instead of `1.0 - pow(d, 3.0)` — exact, and faster. Outside world gen they remain fine.

Method note: measured on an Unraid KVM guest, because the guest is x86_64. A UTM guest on the MacBook
would have held the CPU architecture constant and returned a green result that meant nothing (F-006).
The trap this decision avoided is the reverse of the obvious one — the risk register expected noise to
break and it didn't; what broke was the falloff maths nobody was worried about.

**Would change my mind:** (1) **Windows x86_64 disagreeing on `rng_sequence` or `noise_*`** — MSVC is a
third C library and is still unmeasured; that result would reinstate the fallback outright. (2) World
gen needing `TYPE_CELLULAR` or domain warp, which are separate code paths and untested. (3) Any future
requirement for lockstep simulation beyond terrain, where the ban would have to widen from world gen
to all shared simulation and would start costing real ergonomics.

### D-018 · 2026-08-15 · Task 0.5 movement feel — tuned values for `player_controller.gd`
Sequoyah played the greybox (ramps, stairs, gaps) and tuned live. Verdict: acceleration, friction,
jump height, coyote/buffer time and jump-cut all felt right at their defaults and are untouched.
Three values moved:

| | was | now |
|---|---|---|
| `walk_speed` | 5.0 | **4.0** |
| `sprint_speed` | 8.0 | **6.0** |
| `gravity_scale` | 1.6 | **2.0** |

Walk/sprint came down — Muck-fast read as too fast once there was real geometry to navigate, not just
open ground. Gravity went up so falls read heavier; `jump_height` (1.1, apex in metres) is unchanged
and unaffected, since launch velocity is derived from `gravity_scale × jump_height` — raising gravity
alone shortens time-to-apex without changing how high the jump reads.
Written into the script defaults directly rather than left as a live Inspector override, so a fresh
Player instance — or anyone who resets to defaults — doesn't silently revert to the untuned feel.
**Would change my mind:** the values reading differently once ramps/stairs/gaps are dressed with real
art instead of greybox, or co-op play at 3–6 players surfacing a pace mismatch invisible solo.

### D-019 · 2026-08-15 · Stop pinning default-equal project.godot settings by hand — check effective values instead
F-003 was "fixed" twice by hand-writing four settings into `project.godot` that equal the engine
default. Both times an unrelated editor save (once a Project Settings edit, once just setting the main
scene) silently pruned them again. That's not bad luck — Godot's editor prunes any setting matching the
default on *every* save it performs, regardless of how the value got there, so hand-writing it is not a
fix, it's a fix with a timer on it.

Sequoyah caught this: "I don't think it matters... that's why they disappeared before, no?" — correctly
identifying that the second fix attempt (mine) was about to repeat the first one's mistake.

`tools/verify_setup.gd` now asserts the effective value via `ProjectSettings.get_setting()`, which
returns the override when present and the engine default otherwise — correct either way, and it only
fails on the case that's actually dangerous: a value changed *away* from the target, which (unlike the
default) does persist on save. `ARCHITECTURE.md` §5a no longer instructs pinning these by hand.
**Would change my mind:** a future Godot version changing one of these defaults — the actual protection
against that was always "pin the Godot version, don't upgrade mid-milestone" (already policy), not file
text, since file text couldn't survive an editor save either way.

### D-020 · 2026-08-15 · Drop fixed planner/coder roles — any agent takes any task, allocated by quota
*Supersedes D-014's role assignment.* D-014 pinned "Claude Code chat = planner" and "Codex, second
Claude = coders" as fixed identities. Sequoyah: "I don't want specific roles for specific instances of
Codex or Claude. They can all do any task I set to them. What they get just depends on what usage
quotas are available."
The underlying reasoning in D-014 — concentrate expensive decisions, push implementation to whichever
plan has quota room — still holds and isn't rejected here, only the binding of specific roles to
specific agent identities. Any agent (this chat included) may implement `.gd` code; task assignment
follows quota availability, not a fixed table.
**Would change my mind:** quota contention making it valuable again to reserve one plan strictly for
planning — but that would be re-decided explicitly, not assumed from D-014.
