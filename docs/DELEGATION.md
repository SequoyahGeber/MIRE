# Delegation — ready-to-paste task prompts

**How to use this file:** find the task, select from its `## Task N.N` heading down to the end of its
fenced block, paste that into a fresh chat, and set the model and effort named just under the heading.
Nothing here is for you to run — every command lives inside the prompt and the agent executes it.

Each block is self-contained on purpose: the agent never needs to explore, which is the single most
expensive thing an agent can do (`AI-WORKFLOW.md` §4).

**Each parallel chat needs its own identity.** `.agent/session` holds exactly one name, so two chats
started without this overwrite each other and claims get misattributed to the wrong agent — which
defeats the entire point of claiming. The name is passed per command:

```bash
MIRE_AGENT=net .agent/bin/agent claim 1.2 autoload/net_transport.gd
```

**Per command, not `export`.** Agent tools run each shell call in a fresh process, so a bare
`export MIRE_AGENT=net` on its own line is gone by the next command and the agent silently falls back
to whatever `.agent/session` happens to hold. It fails quietly and produces exactly the misattributed
claim the identity is there to prevent. Every prompt below carries the prefix on each command.

**Including `git commit`.** The pre-commit hook re-runs `agent check` under git's environment, so an
unprefixed commit is checked against the wrong identity and can be blocked despite valid claims.
Prefer `agent ship`, which gets this right on its own.

**Roles are not fixed (D-020).** Any agent can take any task; which one gets it depends on which plan
has quota. Nothing below is reserved for a particular chat.

---

## Current state — check `.agent/BOARD.md` before pasting anything

| # | Task | Agent name | Model | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.2 | NetTransport autoload | `net` | Opus 5 | xhigh | **done**, registered and verified booting |
| 2.2 | Content framework | `content` | Sonnet 5 | medium | **done** — prompt kept for reference only |

**1.2 landed and its interface is confirmed good**, so 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.10 and 1.11 are all
unblocked. `NetTransport` and `Registry` are registered in `project.godot` and boot clean.

**Next is 1.3** — the one-keypress two-window LOCAL loop. The roadmap calls it the highest-ROI task in
M1 and it's right: every multiplayer bug for the rest of the project gets cheaper to find once it
exists. No prompt written for it yet.

**Yours, not delegable:** 1.1 (GodotSteam GDExtension + `project.godot`), which 1.4 then needs, and
1.12 needs both. `4.0b` (Windows determinism) is yours only to the extent of provisioning the VM.

M0 is closed. The 0.7 and 0.8 spike prompts that used to live here shipped in `9a1bc19` / `9ebe47b` —
their results are D-015 and D-016 in `DECISIONS.md`. The unmeasured half of R2 is now task `4.0a`.

## Task 1.2 — NetTransport autoload

> **Model: Opus 5 · effort xhigh** · agent name `net`
> Every other M1 task sits on this interface. Getting it right is worth the spend.

```
You're working on MIRE, a co-op survival game in Godot 4.7.1. Read AGENTS.md and
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §2 (all of §2 — it defines the networking model) before writing
code. Then:

    MIRE_AGENT=net .agent/bin/agent start net
    MIRE_AGENT=net .agent/bin/agent claim 1.2 autoload/net_transport.gd core/net/net_config.gd project.godot

Keep the MIRE_AGENT=net prefix on EVERY .agent/bin/agent command you run, including
done and ship. Do not use `export` — each shell call is a fresh process, so an
exported value is gone by your next command and your claims get filed under the
wrong agent without any error.

TASK: Build the NetTransport autoload — one interface that swaps between transports so
no gameplay code ever knows which one is live. This is the foundation of milestone M1;
everything else in the milestone plugs into it.

Three modes (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §2.3):
  LOCAL  — ENetMultiplayerPeer on 127.0.0.1. Daily development: two windows, one
           machine, no Steam client, ~3 second iteration loop.
  LAN    — ENetMultiplayerPeer on a real address.
  STEAM  — SteamMultiplayerPeer via GodotSteam.

SCOPE FOR THIS TASK: implement LOCAL and LAN fully. For STEAM, define the code path
and leave it behind a clean seam that returns a clear "not yet installed" error —
GodotSteam isn't installed yet (that's task 1.1, and it's mine to do). Task 1.4 fills
in the Steam implementation. Design the seam so 1.4 is a drop-in, not a refactor.

Write exactly two files:

1. core/net/net_config.gd — class_name NetConfig, extends RefCounted
   Mode enum, default port, max players (6), timeouts. No logic.

2. autoload/net_transport.gd — the autoload. Public API, exactly this shape so the
   rest of M1 can be written against it:

     signal peer_joined(peer_id: int)
     signal peer_left(peer_id: int)
     signal connection_failed(reason: String)
     signal connected_to_host()
     signal server_started()
     signal disconnected()

     func host(mode: NetConfig.Mode, port: int = -1) -> Error
     func join(mode: NetConfig.Mode, address: String, port: int = -1) -> Error
     func leave() -> void
     func is_host() -> bool
     func local_peer_id() -> int
     func peer_ids() -> PackedInt32Array
     func current_mode() -> NetConfig.Mode

REQUIREMENTS:
- Wrap Godot's MultiplayerAPI; do not make callers touch multiplayer.multiplayer_peer.
- Handle the full lifecycle: host quits, client times out, join fails, leave and rejoin
  in the same process without restarting. That last one matters — it's what makes the
  two-window loop fast.
- Emit signals rather than requiring polling.
- Log through the existing MireLog class (core/util/mire_log.gd, class_name MireLog).
  Read that file to match its API — it's the one file worth opening.
- Typed GDScript, all of it.

AUTHORITY: this is infrastructure, not simulated state. But read the authority table
in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §2.2 and note in a file-header comment which rows this enables.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Scene files (.tscn/.tres) stay human-only (D-007, hook-enforced).
- project.godot IS yours here: your claim names it, which D-012/D-021 permit. Register
  the autoload yourself rather than handing me a checklist. Append one line to the
  [autoload] section; do not reformat or reorder the file, and do not add settings that
  equal the engine default — Godot's editor prunes those on its next save (D-019).
- BEFORE editing project.godot, confirm the Godot editor is not running (pgrep -fl Godot).
  If it is, STOP and tell me — the editor rewrites that file on save and will silently
  discard your change. This is the one condition that makes wiring not yours.
- Don't explore the codebase beyond mire_log.gd. Everything else you need is here.

DELIVERABLE: also give me a 5-line snippet showing how task 1.3 (the two-window LOCAL
launcher) will call this, so I can sanity-check the interface before we build on it.

FINISH WITH:
    MIRE_AGENT=net .agent/bin/agent done 1.2 "<what works, what's stubbed>"
  (or handoff, if something is genuinely unfinished)
    MIRE_AGENT=net .agent/bin/agent ship 1.2 "M1: NetTransport autoload"

`ship` commits only this task's files and pushes to origin. Never `git add -A` —
other agents are working in this same directory and you would commit their
half-written files.

THEN, as your final chat message, tell me:
  - what you verified, with the actual command you ran and its output. If you
    could not run it, say so — do not describe unrun code as working
  - whether the feature actually RUNS now, or only compiles. You registered the
    autoload yourself, so "shipped" and "working" should finally be the same
    thing; if they aren't, say which one this is
  - anything still needing a .tscn/.tres change, which is genuinely mine
  - whether it is safe for me to start the next task

```

## Already shipped — kept for reference

## Task 2.2 — Content resource framework ✅ **DONE**

> **Model: Sonnet 5 · effort medium** · agent name `content`
> **Completed 2026-08-16. Do not paste this.** Kept only as a worked example of a
> framework-shaped prompt, since M2 has several more of them.

```
You're working on MIRE, a co-op survival game in Godot 4.7.1. Read AGENTS.md first.
Then:

    MIRE_AGENT=content .agent/bin/agent start content
    MIRE_AGENT=content .agent/bin/agent claim 2.2 core/content/item_def.gd core/content/recipe_def.gd autoload/registry.gd

Keep the MIRE_AGENT=content prefix on EVERY .agent/bin/agent command you run,
including done and ship. Do not use `export` — each shell call is a fresh process,
so an exported value is gone by your next command and your claims get filed under
the wrong agent without any error.

TASK: Build the content resource framework — the thing that makes adding the 60th
powerup cost the same as the 2nd (docs/DECISIONS.md D-006).

Three files:

1. core/content/item_def.gd — class_name ItemDef, extends Resource
   @export'd: id (StringName), display_name, description, icon (Texture2D),
   max_stack (int), tags (Array[StringName]), tier (int).
   All @export so items are authored in the Godot inspector, not in code.

2. core/content/recipe_def.gd — class_name RecipeDef, extends Resource
   @export'd: id, inputs (Dictionary of item id -> count), output item id,
   output count, required station (StringName), craft_time (float).

3. autoload/registry.gd — loads every .tres under content/ at boot into typed
   dictionaries keyed by id. Public API:
     func item(id: StringName) -> ItemDef
     func recipe(id: StringName) -> RecipeDef
     func recipes_for_station(station: StringName) -> Array[RecipeDef]
     func all_items() -> Array[ItemDef]
   Fail loudly at boot on a duplicate or missing id — a silent content bug found at
   runtime costs far more than a hard startup error.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Typed GDScript throughout, including typed Arrays and Dictionaries.
- Registry must be deterministic: iterate directory entries in SORTED order. Load
  order must not vary between machines (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §4 — we ship on macOS,
  Windows and Linux and their filesystems enumerate differently).
- Do NOT author any actual item or recipe content. Framework only. I author content
  by hand in the inspector — that's free, and it's the whole point of this design.

AUTHORITY: none — this is static content loaded identically on every peer. Nothing
here is replicated; nothing here is mutable at runtime.

CONSTRAINTS:
- .gd files only. NEVER touch .tscn/.tres/project.godot (D-007, hook-enforced).
  You cannot register the autoload — tell me what to register.
- Don't explore. Everything you need is in this prompt.

FINISH WITH:
    MIRE_AGENT=content .agent/bin/agent done 2.2 "<what you built>"
    MIRE_AGENT=content .agent/bin/agent ship 2.2 "M2: content resource framework"

`ship` commits only this task's files and pushes to origin. Never `git add -A` —
other agents are working in this same directory and you would commit their
half-written files.

THEN, as your final chat message, tell me:
  - what you verified, with the actual command you ran and its output. If you
    could not run it, say so — do not describe unrun code as working
  - whether the feature actually RUNS now, or only compiles. You registered the
    autoload yourself, so "shipped" and "working" should finally be the same
    thing; if they aren't, say which one this is
  - anything still needing a .tscn/.tres change, which is genuinely mine
  - whether it is safe for me to start the next task

## Not yet — M4 gate, written down now while the context is fresh

## Task 4.0a — Spike R2b: chunk collision cooking + GPU upload

> **Model: Opus 5 · effort high** · agent name `collide`
> **Do not start this during M1.** It's parked here so the reasoning behind it doesn't have to be
> rebuilt from `FINDINGS.md` F-005 in three milestones' time. Run it immediately before task 4.1.

```
You're working on MIRE, a co-op survival game in Godot 4.7.1. Read AGENTS.md first —
it's the protocol every agent here follows. Then:

    MIRE_AGENT=collide .agent/bin/agent start collide
    MIRE_AGENT=collide .agent/bin/agent claim 4.0a tools/bench_chunk_collide.gd

Keep the MIRE_AGENT=collide prefix on EVERY .agent/bin/agent command you run,
including done and ship. Do not use `export` — each shell call is a fresh process,
so an exported value is gone by your next command and your claims get filed under
the wrong agent without any error.

TASK: Spike R2b. Close the half of spike R2 that was never measured.

BACKGROUND — read this carefully, it is the whole point of the task:
R2 (task 0.7) benchmarked chunk mesh generation at 0.330 ms/chunk and came back GREEN.
It ran HEADLESS against the dummy renderer, so it measured noise sampling and vertex
array construction and NOTHING ELSE — no GPU buffer upload, no material, no collision
shape. R3 (task 0.8) measured NAVIGATION baking, which people assume covers this. It
does not: physics collision cooking is a different code path from Recast navmesh
generation. So the chunk streaming budget for task 4.3 is currently derived from a
number that excludes two costs that could each dominate it.

This is recorded as FINDINGS.md F-005 and as the standing caveat on DECISIONS.md D-015.

Reuse world/chunk/chunk_mesher.gd — it exists and is the real mesher from R2. Do not
rewrite it.

Write one file: tools/bench_chunk_collide.gd — extends SceneTree.

Measure, per 32x32m chunk (33x33 verts), averaged over 100 chunks:
  - ms to cook a ConcavePolygonShape3D from the chunk mesh
  - ms to cook the same as a HeightMapShape3D instead — heightfield chunks may not
    need a trimesh at all, and if the heightfield is much cheaper that is the finding
  - whether cooking is threadable (does it block the main thread? try WorkerThreadPool)
  - memory per cooked shape

CRITICAL: this benchmark must NOT run headless with --headless / the dummy renderer.
That is exactly the mistake that made R2 incomplete. Run it windowed against the real
Forward+ renderer so GPU upload is actually exercised:
  /Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path . --script tools/bench_chunk_collide.gd
Measure mesh upload separately from cooking — instance the ArrayMesh into the live scene
tree and time to first rendered frame, so upload cost lands somewhere real.
If you cannot separate upload from cook cleanly, say so and report the combined number
with that stated plainly. A number with an honest caveat is worth more than a clean
number that quietly measures the wrong thing — that is how we got here.

SUCCESS CRITERIA — state which the measurements support, and remember the budget is
shared with meshing (0.330 ms) and nav baking (0.034 ms main-thread block):
   GREEN : cook + upload < 4 ms/chunk, or cook is threadable → 4.3 streams as designed
   AMBER : 4-15 ms → 4.3 needs a chunk budget per frame; say how many chunks/frame fit
   RED   : >15 ms and not threadable → chunk size or collision strategy must change
           before 4.1 is written. Evaluate HeightMapShape3D-only as the fallback.

AUTHORITY: none — offline generation, no networking.

CONSTRAINTS:
- .gd files only. NEVER create or edit .tscn/.tres/project.godot (D-007, hook-enforced).
- Typed GDScript.
- Deterministic: seeded RandomNumberGenerator / FastNoiseLite.seed only, never global
  randi(). And per D-017 + ARCHITECTURE.md §7, no sin/cos/tan/exp/log/pow anywhere in
  seed-derived generation — those diverge ~1 ULP across platforms.
- Don't explore the codebase beyond chunk_mesher.gd. Ask if genuinely blocked.

FINISH WITH:
    MIRE_AGENT=collide .agent/bin/agent done 4.0a "<the numbers, and which of GREEN/AMBER/RED they support>"
    MIRE_AGENT=collide .agent/bin/agent ship 4.0a "M4: chunk collision + upload spike (R2b)"

`ship` commits only this task's files and pushes to origin. Never `git add -A` —
other agents are working in this same directory and you would commit their
half-written files.

THEN, as your final chat message, tell me:
  - what you verified and the actual numbers/command
  - whether it is safe for me to start 4.1
  - the text to amend onto DECISIONS.md D-015, since this either confirms or
    overturns its GREEN verdict
```

---

## When they finish

Each agent ends with `agent done` or `agent handoff`, which releases its claims and writes
`.agent/JOURNAL.md` itself. `ship` commits and pushes its own files. So there's usually nothing for you
to run — read `.agent/BOARD.md` to see what landed, or ask any chat to summarise it.

What *is* yours: the wiring. Agents can't touch `.tscn`/`.tres`/`project.godot` (D-007), so a shipped
script is often not a working feature until you register an autoload or add a node. Every prompt here
ends by demanding the agent state plainly whether the thing works yet — believe that section over the
word "done".

For 1.2 specifically: **sanity-check the interface snippet it gives you before starting 1.3.** Seven
tasks get written against that shape, so changing it afterwards isn't a fix, it's a refactor across the
milestone. Paste the snippet into a fresh chat and ask whether the API holds up, if you want a second
read on it.
